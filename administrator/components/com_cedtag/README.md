# Tag for Joomla 2.5

## About
CedTag displays a list of tags in what is called a 'tag cloud', where the size of each tag is determined by how many times that particular tag has been assigned to posts.
Additionally, it is possible to sort tags by count and alphabetically at the same time. It is also possible to add a counter to the tags, so that your visitors can see how many posts are associated with each tag. The plugin also adds a sensible CSS class to every tag.
